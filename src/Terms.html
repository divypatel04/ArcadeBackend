                      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
                      carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
                      You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other
                      languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
                      intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Divy Patel.

                    <p>
                      Divy Patel is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
                      to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app
                      or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

                      The Arcade: Valorant stat Analytics app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service.
                      It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or
                      root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system
                      of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
                      features and it could mean that the Arcade: Valorant stat Analytics app won’t work properly or at all.

                      You should be aware that there are certain things that Divy Patel will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app
                      will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
                      provider, but Divy Patel cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to
                      Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile
                      network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration
                      of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for
                      any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
                      without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
                      that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Along the same lines, Divy Patel cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that
                      your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Divy Patel cannot accept
                      responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With respect to Divy Patel’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
                      that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
                      information to us so that we can make it available to you. Divy Patel accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
                      experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system(and
                      for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the
                      updates if you want to keep using the app. Divy Patel does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
                      to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
                      updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
                      time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
                      licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
                      I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
