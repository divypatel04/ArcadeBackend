                    <p>
                      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
                      browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
                    </p>

                      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies”
                      to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a

                    <h3><strong>Service Providers</strong></h3>
                    <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

                      protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and
                      reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
